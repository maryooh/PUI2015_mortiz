For my optional distributions I used a standard student 'standard_t' and a geometric distribution. I worked with Hannah Kates and 
Dara Perl, and we discussed the assignment and did some troubleshooting. We each used slightly different parameters. 

For Task 1, please look at the HW3-Task1.ipynb, for Task 2 please look at Ortiz_effectivenes of NYC Post-Prison Employment Programs.ipynb

#Hopefully the next folder for my assigments will look more organized...
