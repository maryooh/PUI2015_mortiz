#Homework 6

Done in collaboration with Dara Perl.

The assignment looked at MTA data for 600 stations over a period of 194 weeks. The data broke down the card swipes by user type, and we were tasked with detecting an event, identifying trending user types and looking at ratios of change, and finally identifying stations with the most prominent periodic trend. It would have been interesting to see where these specific stations were. For example, recently this past Saturday, I was trapped under the W 4 St station as I was trying to cross from one side of 6th Ave to the other during the peak of the Halloween Parade. I had never seen so many people streaming out of one subway entrance! 

Dara has a very structured way of thinking through the questions which helped me understand how to tackle the tasks, and what to look for in the resulting arrays.  My contribution was looking for better ways of visualizing the data and suggesting structures while Dara was the master code executioner.
