![I deleted my notebooks](verylate.png)

For this assignment I worked with Dara Perl, Michelle Ho, Danyan Crull, Maria Filipari, and Nate.
We all used slightly different seeds, variable names, and structures.

I learned the hard way that a hard reset on your terminal deletes all your local files...so after 10+ hours of work, I deleted them all at 12 30 am.

Lesson learned! Meanwhile, I am (and so are many of my classmates!) in need of a thorough Git tutorial.
