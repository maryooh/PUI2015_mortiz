#Homework 5

For this assignment I worked with Dara and Michelle and received help from Diogo, Xia, Bibby.

The objective of the assignments was to fit regression lines to our plots to learn what the best fit was and be able to look at our errors, and perhaps do a comparison with the likelihood ratio test. We also looked at the predictive power of observed values.
